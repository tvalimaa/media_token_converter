# media token converter

This a little module is very early version and has many problems and is not flexible. This was fast fix for my media token problems at the same time I learned D8 text filters. 

How to use:

1. Move file_managed sql table to d8 database and rename it migrate_map_d7_file_managed

2. Move files to d8 file system. E.g /sites/default/files/d7/

3. Enable Media token module

4. Enable Media token filter
